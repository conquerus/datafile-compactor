* Data file compactor

** Overview

A specialized compression program for ASCII data files, such as those
being generated by a scientific code. The compression is done using
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding][Huffman coding]] for a limited set of characters (those that you would
expect to find in ASCII data files e.g 0-9, +, -, E).

At the moment the code contains a lot of hard-coded values (for the
characters and weights). The weights were found using the =count_chars=
code, which is also found in this repo.

** Installation

For the main compression program: ~make adcom~

For the character counting: ~make char_count~

** Future

In it's present state the code is still incomplete. After I found that
=tar= is still much more efficient at compressing these types of files
I lost motivation to continue with the project. Although I did learn a lot,
such as Huffman coding, and got a lot of practice with linked lists.
